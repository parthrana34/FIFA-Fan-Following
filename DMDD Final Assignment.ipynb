    "Some of our observations were:\n",
    "1. Most of the players who were in top 100 list of Fifa 17 have retained their positions in Fifa 19.\n",
    "2. Messi have turned the tables in Fifa 19 and is the leading the list with overall 94. Cristiano Ronaldo was at the top of the list in Fifa 17.\n",
    "3. Many players have changed club over the period of two years. Example: Ronaldo moved from Real Madriad to Juventus in 2019.\n",
    "4. Cristiano Ronaldo has been most popular player in th list with maximum followers on twitter followed by Neymar and then Luis Suarez.\n",

    "1. We gathered Fifa_17 data using web scraping and Fifa_19 data using Kaggle to find how the top 100 players of Fifa 17 have performed over the period of two years and what are their ratings in Fifa 19 through attributes like Overall, Value, Potential, and different statistics like heading, accuracy etc. \n",
    "2. Also, we tried to find their social impact by counting their number of followers on twitter.\n"
